# About
Roblox Photoshop connects Adobe Photoshop to Roblox Studio for seamless image editing. 

# How it works 
There are two main scenarios: 
1. #### Save any Photoshop document as Roblox image asset and copy it's AssetID![new file upload](https://github.com/roblox-integrations/roblox-photoshop/assets/3534732/98dfb785-8605-4bc0-88d7-951657669bef)

2. #### Open any image in your Roblox place for editing and hot-swap the AssetId directly in Studio![edit-workflow-short](https://github.com/roblox-integrations/roblox-photoshop/assets/3534732/3587c100-65ed-47a0-baa7-246092f9bd06)





# Installation 
Install the [latest release of  Roblox Integration Hub application](http://example.com), run it and extract and install Photoshop and Studio plugins. 

### Photoshop Plugin Installation 
Click 'Download the Photoshop plugin' in the [Roblox Integration Hub](http://example.com) app, and then double-click the saved plugin file. The plugin is found in the main menu's Plugins->Roblox Photoshop Plugin. 
To upload assets, you'll need to provide an Open Cloud API Key. 
1. In [Creator Dashboad](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/credentials?activeTab=ApiKeysTab) click Create API Key, name it 'Photoshop Plugin', in 'Access Permission' select API System Assets, add both 'read' and 'write' permissions and use 0.0.0.0/0 as IP subnet, then generate and copy the API key. ![add api key](https://github.com/roblox-integrations/roblox-photoshop/assets/3534732/6bca3e51-ea31-40b3-8ca2-de75fc9f8bab).
2. Get your user ID. Go to [roblox.com](htts://roblox.com), click on your profile, and copy the numeric value from the URL in the browser: ![user id](https://github.com/roblox-integrations/roblox-photoshop/assets/3534732/648b7a07-2637-474b-92c9-662efb0f399d)





### Roblox Studio Plugin Installation 
Click 'Download the Studio plugin' in the Roblox Integration Hub app. Then, in the Studio ribbon, click the 'Plugins' tab, click on the 'Plugins Folder' button, and double-copy the plugin file there(if you have an older version, please replace it).

# What's Roblox Integration Hub?

Roblox Integration Hub is a desktop app for Windows and Mac that allows Roblox Studio plugins to connect to other applications by exposing a local web server. It's free from the sandbox limitations of Studio(or third-party applications) plugins, which enables complex integration scenarios that require filesystem access, running native utilities, and so on. 
It also tracks new integration releases and could be a great way to discover new apps that can work with Roblox.  

Today, Roblox Integration Hub supports Photoshop, and it can be extended with others in the future.
