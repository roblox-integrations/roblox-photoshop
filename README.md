# About 
The first integration of [Roblox Integration Hub](https://github.com/roblox-integrations/roblox-photoshop?tab=readme-ov-file#whats-roblox-integration-hub), which connects Adobe Photoshop to Roblox Studio for seamless image editing. Integration with Blender is coming next. 

# How it works 
There are two main scenarios: 

#### 1. Open any image in your Roblox place for editing and hot-swap the AssetID directly in Studio![edit-workflow-short](https://github.com/roblox-integrations/roblox-photoshop/assets/3534732/3587c100-65ed-47a0-baa7-246092f9bd06)

#### 2. Save any Photoshop document as Roblox image asset and copy it's AssetID![new file upload](https://github.com/roblox-integrations/roblox-photoshop/assets/3534732/98dfb785-8605-4bc0-88d7-951657669bef)



# Installation 
Download and run the [latest release of Roblox Integration Hub](https://github.com/roblox-integrations/roblox-photoshop/releases/latest), and follow the [configuration instructions](https://github.com/roblox-integrations/roblox-photoshop/blob/main/INSTALL.MD). 


# What's Roblox Integration Hub?

[Roblox Integration Hub](https://github.com/roblox-integrations/roblox-photoshop/releases/latest) is a desktop app for Windows and Mac that allows Roblox Studio plugins to connect to other applications by exposing a local web server. It's free from the sandbox limitations of Studio(or third-party applications) plugins, which enables complex integrations that might require filesystem access, running native utilities, and so on.

It also tracks new integration releases and could be a great way to discover better creative workflows for Roblox.  

Today, Roblox Integration Hub supports image editing with **Photoshop**, support for Blender is coming next, and it can be expended with apps like Figma, FMOD Studio and more!
