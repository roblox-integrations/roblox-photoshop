**Studio Plugin Iteration Workflow**

Plugin development requires [Rojo](https://rojo.space/docs/v7/getting-started/installation/)

## Getting Started

To build this plugin to your local plugins folder, run this in a terminal:

```bash
rojo build -p PhotoshopIntegration.rbxm
```

If you want the plugin to rebuild on save, include the "--watch" argument:

```bash
rojo build -p PhotoshopIntegration.rbxm --watch
```

For more help, check out [the Rojo documentation](https://rojo.space/docs).
